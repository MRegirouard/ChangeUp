## The Game
[Change Up Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxs0q9UoMDQ)

The object of the game is to score the most points by placing _balls_ in _goals_ and connecting _rows_. There are **32** _balls_, **16** _red_ and **16** _blue_. Each robot starts with one of their _balls_ as a _preload_. There are **9** _goals_ in a 3 by 3 grid on the field, where _balls_ can be scored. _Balls_ are **6.3 inches** in diameter, and worth **1 point** for their alliance color when scored in a _goal_. Alliances can take _ownership_ of a _goal_ by having the top scored _ball_ in the _goal_. If an alliance has **3** owned _goals_ in a _row_, they recieve an additional **6** bonus points for connecting the _row_. However, during the driver control period, robots are allowed to remove _balls_ from any _goal_ at any time. The alliance that wins the 15 second autonomous period is awared with a **6** point bonus. Alliances may also win **1** additional win point by completing their _home row_ (the _row_ of _goals_ closest to their alliance station) during the autonomous period.
